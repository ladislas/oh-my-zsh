Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) configuration. That sounds boring. Let's try this again.

__Oh My Zsh is a way of life!__ Once installed, your terminal prompt will become the talk of the town _or your money back!_ Each time you interface with your command prompt, you'll be able take advantage of the hundreds of bundled plugins and pretty themes. Strangers will come up to you in caf√©s and ask you, _"that is amazing. are you some sort of genius?"_ Finally, you'll begin to get the sort of attention that you always felt that you deserved. ...or maybe you'll just use the time that you saved to start flossing more often.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

__Disclaimer:__ _Oh My Zsh works best on Mac OS X and Linux._

* Unix-based operating system (Mac OS X or Linux)
* [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org) should be installed (v4.3.9 or more recent). If not a simple `brew install zsh` should do the job
* `curl` or `wget` should be installed
* `git` should be installed

### Basic Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/ladislas/oh-my-zsh ~/.oh-my-zsh`

#### 2. *Optionally*, backup your existing `~/.zshrc` file:

`cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig`

#### 3. Symlink the configuration file

I've customized a great `.zshrc` file that should get you up and running!

`ln -s ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrcDot.zsh-template ~/.zshrc`

You can also create a new zsh config file by copying the template that we included for you.

`cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc`

#### 4. Change your default shell

`chsh -s /bin/zsh` or `chsh -s $(which zsh)` if using `brew`. Note that you should edit `/etc/shells` on OS X Yosemite.
